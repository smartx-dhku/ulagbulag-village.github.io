## UlagBulag Village

Our company provides innovative solutions by dividing and conquering the entire data pipeline from Bare-metal to FaaS.

* Open Source: In many cases, our solutions are open sourced and available for free.
* Blockchain: If you are in a situation where it is difficult to build and maintain some parts of the data pipeline, you can take advantage of the powerful blockchain-based decentralized data pipeline solutions.
